# Deep Learning  (Master X Data Science ,Paris 2019-2020)


* Deep Learning (machine learning based on deep artificial neural
networks) has become extremely popular over the last years due to the
very good results it allows for regression, classification or generation.
The objective of this course is to cover the three main types of
networks (multi-layer-perceptron, recurrent-neural-network and con-
volutional neural network). 


* This course range from the perceptron to
the generation of adversarial images.
Each lesson is followed by a corresponding lab where student learn
to implement these networks using the currently most popular frame-
works (tensorflow, pytorch and keras).
